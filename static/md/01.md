### 01. Particles, lots of them. (credit: Melissa Wiederrecht & Nicolas Barradeau)

When I hear particles, I think particle systems. A basic particle system consists of an emitter and the particles it emits.
Usually these particles then also have their own properties, like velocity, size, color,... that change over time.
This makes it a great choice for creating all kinds of effects, like fireworks, smoke, rain, snow...

But that's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to play with the essential elements of a particle system in an unusual way.
That's why I decided to have the emitter move along a predefined path, only emitting particles at very specific positions.
Something a particle system is not necessarily designed to do. But here we are.
The fact that we're dealing with particles is represented by the particle count at the top, but becomes also apparent as each of the particles fades in its own rhythm.

You can turn on the debug lines, which will show you the emitter moving along its path to illustrate what I mean.

This very first entry I already came eye to eye with the limitations of paper.js. That wasn't really designed to create a massive amount of rectangles or whatnot on the fly.
So I optimized things a bit by creating all particles at the start of an iteration and then just making them visible as the emitter moves along.
