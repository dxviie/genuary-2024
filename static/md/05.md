I haven't started on this one yet, but have been a great admirer of Vera Molnár's work ever since I got to know her.
In fact the very first *work* I did in public was to recreate one of her pieces in Processing. You can head over to OpenProcessing.org and see [my remake of "Comprendre c'est transformer"](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1857733) there.

I also made another piece inspired by this re-creation. It's also up on [OpenProcessing.org](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1986467). If you're still hungry after that you could always check out [my blog](https://www.d17e.dev/blog/) or [posts](https://www.d17e.dev/posts/) for more.

For this prompt I have found inspiration in her work titled ["À la recherche de Paul Klee (1970-71)"](https://dam.org/museum/artists_ui/artists/molnar-vera/a-la-recherche-de-paul-klee/).
It fits perfect with the reason I decided on paper.js (generating [plotter](https://www.axidraw.com/) ready SVGs) and also has something intriguing in the title of the work (again).
A work that she made in search of the late Paul Klee, will now guide me in making in search of her, the great late Vera Molnár. May she rest in peace. &#x2661;
