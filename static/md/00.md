Genuary is the generative art month of the year. 31 days, 31 prompts, 31 sketches. Ish.

This year I decided to join in on the fun and I created this mini site to host my entries. 
I'm using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (& SvelteKit) and [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) to create the sketches. Both are technologies that I was keen on getting to know a bit better, which lead to this choice.

The idea is to stick to these bare technologies as much as possible, only using external libraries when absolutely necessary.
Let's see how that goes.
