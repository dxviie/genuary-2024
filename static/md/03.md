### 03. Droste effect. (credit: Stranger in the Q)

#### [Wikipedia: Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect)

In case you didn't click the wiki link, here's the definition for you:

> The Droste effect (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdrɔstə]), known in art as an example of mise en abyme, is the effect of a picture recursively appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear. This produces a loop which in theory could go on forever, but in practice only continues as far as the image's resolution allows.

I wasn't particularly inspired by this one, even though they can be really cool, so I decided to skip today.
Until I sat down to start with prompt 4 and my OCD walked in the door convincing me that sure I could make one for 3 as well real quick.

Well, I guess we know who won the argument.
