### 19. Flocking (credit: Shaderism)

#### And a little bit of 20. Generative typography. (credit: Roni Kaufman)

I think [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) must've been one of the first times I came into contact with processing and 'creative coding'. 
At that time I believe we were still calling it 'new media art'. Whatever it is and was called, it caught my attention and I never really let go of it.

So to wrap up this year's Genuary, I thought it was the perfect prompt to end with. And as my AI copilot easily spat out an implementation - that actually worked - 
as I typed in _class Boid_, I went ahead and tried to make them stay inside a big fat random Arial Black letter.

Which... kind of works. Sometimes. 

Something to work on for next year, I guess. Until then!
