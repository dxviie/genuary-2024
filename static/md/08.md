### 08. Chaotic system. (credit: Darien Brito)

On refresh 1 out of 5 stable configuration is selected. Press play to start the simulation.
You can move the planets before starting the simulation.

Note!! This is work in progress. But I thought, if you've made it here, you might as well see how it's going.
