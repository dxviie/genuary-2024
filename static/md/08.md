When I first read this prompt, I first thought of chaotic systems like the weather and stock markets,
and how it could be interesting to visualize realtime data from one or more of those systems.
But then I went to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) and found this:

<div class="centered">
    <img alt="animated gif of a double pendulum" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Double-compound-pendulum.gif"/> 
    <div class="img-text">

        The double-rod pendulum is one of the simplest dynamical systems with chaotic solutions.

    </div>

That line in bold caught my attention: "Starting the pendulum from a slightly different initial condition would result in a vastly different trajectory."
That reminds me of something... Didn't [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) have a [video with planets or something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7axImc1sxa0&t=237s) that had something similar?

And then I stumbled onto the 3 body problem on the wiki. Right! That was it! And it seemed like something fun and easy to implement.
Just one simple physics rule, Newton's law of universal gravitation:

> **F = G m<sub>1</sub> m<sub>2</sub>**

Which was especially easy since Sebastian already [did the hard work](https://youtu.be/7axImc1sxa0?t=78) and I just had to type it over.

That's around the time I realized that implementing this system was not the hard part...
The hard part had pretty much been staring me in the face from the start but was only starting to seep in now.

> "Starting the pendulum from a slightly different initial condition would result in a vastly different trajectory."

Right. One of the key characteristic of a chaotic system is that it's very sensitive to initial conditions.
Which, for our 3 body problem, translates into: There's only so many _stable_ initial conditions.
An initial condition is defined by the positions and velocities of the 3 bodies.

So where would I find those? After some [duckduckgoing](https://duckduckgo.com/), I found that in order to solve this problem some mathematics would be required.
Hmm... I felt out of my depth. I asked an LLM that made some good attempts but ended with bad or incomplete results.
I almost gave up. But then I found what appears to be [somebodies advanced math homework on GitHub](https://github.com/mws262/MAE5730_examples/tree/master/3BodySolutions)!
And it contained a solution for the 3 body problem! I was saved.

It still took me a while to install a matlab trial, get the code running and then figure out how to make it poop out something I could copy-paste into my sketch.
And eventually it did and this came rolling in the console:

```javascript
{
    name: "8",
    positions: [[-0.81763, 0.23240], [0.84385, -0.19304], [-0.02622, -0.03936]],
    velocities: [[-0.54984, -0.43428], [-0.46887, -0.48393], [1.01870, 0.91821]]
}
```

After some tweaking of the system (scaling etc.) I got it to work.

Then all I had left to do was to make it look a bit nicer. And add some controls. And an end-game state.
And a little story. And... no. I think that's it. I need to move on. And eat. And sleep. And stuff.
