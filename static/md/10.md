When I hear hexagons, I think game-world maps. When I hear maps, I think "mmmm, maps...". I do like maps. In fact, I've always wanted to do something with a world map. The time had come.

So I went to look for a world map, preferably as an SVG and turns out, wikipedia has [a whole array of SVG world maps](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_maps_of_the_world). 
I ended up using a map by [SimpleMaps](http://simplemaps.com) though, as it - in fact - was simpler.

The hexagon grid was straightforward to implement, thanks to the great article by [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). 

Then I thought, I'd throw in a [wobbly function (credit to Piter Pasma)](https://piterpasma.nl/articles/wobbly) as:
1. Water **is** wobbly.
2. I'm getting seriously behind on the prompts, so why not two together?
