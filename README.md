# d17e.dev's Genuary 2024 entries

This is a project based on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (& SvelteKit) and [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

### What is this?

It is a collection of my entries for [Genuary 2024](https://genuary.art/prompts). You can find the live project at [genuary.d17e.dev](https://genuary.d17e.dev). The code for each of the prompts is each in its own file, so should be pretty straight forward to find in case you're wondering how I implemented things.

### What is it not?

It is by no means a source of clean code or best practices. I'm still learning Svelte and paper.js, so I'm sure there are better ways to do things. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
